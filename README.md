# **Code-Review2_JS**
#### By Mark Woodward

## _Description_
Allow user to:  
Enter medical issue **OR**
enter a name to receive a list of doctors in the Portland area that fit the search query.  
Matches are displayed with the following information: first name, last name, address, phone number, website and whether or not the doctor is accepting new patients (the API provides this data).
If the API call results in an error, the application will return a notification that states what the error is.
If the query response doesn't include any doctors (for instance, if no doctors meet the search criteria), the application will return a notification that states that no doctors meet the criteria. (This is not an error so it should be handled separately from any errors.)

## _Installation_
